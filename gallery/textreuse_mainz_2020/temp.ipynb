    "Since for many of the subsequent steps, we need a language toolkit like [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) or [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) (to mention just the two best known ones) anyway, and since most of these also provide tokenization capabilities, we refrain from using a homebrew tokenizer like the one listed in the appendix.\n",

    "Actually, there are many Python Lemmatizers, but quite a couple of them are only for English. Some depend on Wordnet resources and may load wordnet data for other languages as well. (I have found an online [comparison](https://lars76.github.io/nlp/lemmatize-portuguese/) of Python Lemmatizers for Portuguese but I cannot tell how reliable it is.) But it seems none of the options is really up to the task, especially (that's my contention now) for historical language variants.\n",

    "However, there is one toolkit -- [FreeLing](http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/) \\[Padró/Stanilovsky 2012\\] -- that is often overlooked and I have used its dictionary of word forms for historical Spanish in the past to some satisfaction \\[also Sanchez-Marco/Boleda/Padró 2011\\]. We will use this one and, besides its dictionary resources, also use some of its more advanced methods. (For sense annotation, FreeLing relies on Wordnet as well, but not for Lemmatization.) For learning about its API and how to use it, you could start [here](https://talp-upc.gitbook.io/freeling-4-1-user-manual/installation/calling-freeling-library-from-languages-other-than-c++). In the appendix, you will find example code for how to use its Python 3 API.)\n",
