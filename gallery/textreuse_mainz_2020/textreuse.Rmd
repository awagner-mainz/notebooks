## Housekeeping

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute
code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

In [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), try executing this
chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor
inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by
pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be
saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to
preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor.
Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead,
the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Prerequisites

This notebook requires the following packages:

- [quanteda](http://quanteda.io/) as NLP package
- [janitor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/index.html) for some simple cleaning
  (even though this should be possible also e.g. with dplyr)
- [readtext](https://readtext.quanteda.io/) (belongs to quanteda, reads files into data objects and parses metadata from filenames)
- magrittr (belongs to the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages,
  providing the pipe operator "%>%")
- dplyr (belongs to the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages as well,
  we use it for dataframe handling and manipulation)

## Introduction

The framers of the Burmese Constitution of 1948 had a couple of constitutions
to draw inspiration from. This notebook documents experiments that intend to
quantify the various influences that can be discerned.

## Texts

We have been working with Plaintext transcriptions that have been established
manually for the following texts:

* [1867: British North America Act](./data/1867_-_GB_-_Great_Britain_-_british_north_america_act.txt)
* [1909: British South Africa Act](./data/1909_-_GB-SA_-_Great_Britain_-_british_south_africa_act)
* [1935: British Government of Burma Act](./data/1935_-_GB_-_Great_Britain_-_british_government_of_burma_act.txt)
* [1937: Constitution of Ireland](./data/1937_-_IE_-_Ireland_-_constitution_of_ireland.txt)

And, of course, the "target" text:
* [1948: Constitution of Burma](./data/1948_-_BU_-_Burma_-_constitution_of_burma.txt)

These texts are all in the `data` folder.

The filenames of the split files have the format
`year_-_code_-_country_-_title.txt`, so we can use the [*readtext* package](https://readtext.quanteda.io/)
to parse that information.

- the filename in the first column (`doc_id`)
- the actual file contents in the second column (`text`)
- five more columns with metadata (`year`, `code`, `country`, `title`, `seqno`)


## Alternative Approach

Before starting, note there is a comparable approach using other libraries to be
found in Kellen Funk's and [https://lincolnmullen.com/](Lincoln Mullen)'s study
of the spread of a certain part of civil legislation in the United States. They
use the
[*textreuse* package](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/textreuse/index.html)
that is nowadays even complemented by a dedicated package for tokenizing texts, [tokenizers](https://lincolnmullen.com/software/tokenizers/index.html). (Here's a
[description](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/textreuse/vignettes/textreuse-pairwise.html)
of the textreuse package and some more elaborate reasoning at <https://lincolnmullen.com/blog/an-introduction-to-the-textreuse-package-with-suggested-applications/#tracing-borrowings-within-a-corpus>.)


## Let's get started

We use the [*quanteda* package](https://quanteda.io/index.html) as the main
NLP package. 

We then proceed as follows:

- build a corpus from all our constitution texts
- segment ("re-shape" in quanteda terminology) it into sentences
- tokenize it into words
- remove some few stopwords
- build a collection of 3-grams
- build a document-feature-matrix `dfmx` with these ngrams

```{r}
# Load packages
library(magrittr)
library(readtext)
library(quanteda)

# === Set defaults and options ===
options("mc.cores" = 4L)      # parallel processing
options(scipen = 999)         # no scientific notation of numbers
quanteda_options(verbose = TRUE,
                 threads = 3,
                 print_dfm_max_ndoc  = 5,
                 print_dfm_max_nfeat = 5,
                 language_stemmer    = "en"
                )
```

We use the [`readtext()`](https://readtext.quanteda.io/) and [`corpus()`]() functions to create
our corpus "mycorpus" and use the [`docvars()`](https://quanteda.io/reference/docvars.html) and [`docnames()`](https://quanteda.io/reference/docnames.html) functions to access/manipulate metadata.

Then, we use the [`corpus_trim()`](https://quanteda.io/reference/corpus_trim.html) and [`corpus_reshape()`](https://quanteda.io/reference/corpus_reshape.html) functions to remove some bits and have more granular things (than whole constitutions) to compare: we segment our corpus into sentences. (Note that quanteda keeps track of which sentence belongs to which original file/constitution.)

```{r}
# Build corpus
mycorpus <- readtext("data/constitutions/*.txt",
                     docvarsfrom = "filenames",
                     dvsep = "_-_",
                     docvarnames = c("year", "code", "country", "title"),
                     encoding = "UTF-8") %>%
            corpus()

# user shorter names for documents instead of full filenames
docnames(mycorpus) <- docvars(mycorpus, "code")

# segment into sentences and exclude sentences shorter than 4 words
mysentences <- corpus_trim(mycorpus, what = "sentences", min_ntoken = 4) %>%
               corpus_reshape(mycorpus,
                              to = "sentences",
                              use_docvars = TRUE)

```

Next, we want to compare the sentences based on the words they contain, so we prepare
a "mytokens" object with quanteda's [`tokens()`](https://quanteda.io/reference/tokens.html)
function. In the process we are removing certain tokens that we consider noise,
like punctuation and numbers. We explicitly remove some, very few, stopwords with the
[`tokens_remove()`](https://quanteda.io/reference/tokens_select.html) function. (In tidy
terminology: we "select" all but a few variables.) Also, we are normalizing tokens into lower-case stems ( [`tokens_tolower()`](https://quanteda.io/reference/tokens_tolower.html) and [`tokens_wordstem()`](https://quanteda.io/reference/tokens_wordstem.html)).

From this "mytokens" object, we then build "mydfm", a document-feature matrix
( [`dfm()`](https://quanteda.io/reference/dfm.html), [tutorial](https://tutorials.quanteda.io/basic-operations/dfm/dfm/))
with token 3-grams:

```{r}
mytokens <- tokens(mysentences,
                   what = "word",
                   remove_numbers = TRUE,
                   remove_punct = TRUE,
                   include_docvars = TRUE) %>%
            tokens_remove(c("the", "of", "and")) %>%
            tokens_tolower() %>%
            tokens_wordstem()
  
mydfm <-  dfm(mytokens,
              what = "word",
              remove_numbers = TRUE,
              stem = TRUE)
```

Here is some summary information and stats:

```{r}
summary(mydfm)
topfeatures(mydfm)
```

Now we can try *quanteda*'s [similarity functions](https://quanteda.io/reference/textstat_simil.html). 
(For more about similarity measures, see <http://article.nadiapub.com/IJDTA/vol10_no2/2.pdf>,
<http://sibiryakov.eu/2011/11/similarity-metrics/>, <https://towardsdatascience.com/familiarity-with-coefficients-of-similarity-73697d357acf>, <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/proxy/vignettes/overview.pdf>.)

We use all Burma sentences as reference features:

```{r}
# This is our similarity measure
similAlgo    <- "dice"    # one of "correlation", "cosine",
                              #    "jaccard", "ejaccard",
                              #    "dice", "edice", "hamman",
                              #    "simple matching"

# This is our similarity threshold
minSimil <- 0.4

mysimil <- textstat_simil(mydfm[!grepl("^BU\\.", docnames(mydfm)),],
                          mydfm[grep("^BU\\.", docnames(mydfm)),],
                          margin = "documents", # "documents" or "features"
                          method = similAlgo,
                          min_simil = minSimil)  
```

Make results available in a nice data frame:

```{r}
# First get and clean a matrix of results:
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)

# create matrix
mysimilmx <- as.matrix(mysimil,
                  row.names = docnames(mydfm)[grep("^BU\\.", docnames(mydfm))]) %>%
             remove_empty(c("rows", "cols"))

# transpose matrix so Burma sentences are observed wrt their similaity to other texts
mysimilmx_t <- t(mysimilmx)

# Then, build a data frame and add more columns with information
mysimildf <- as.data.frame(mysimilmx_t)

mysimildf$id_bu     <- rownames(mysimildf)
mysimildf$text_bu   <- mysentences[mysimildf$id_bu]
```

Finally, we want to create reports, and these should not have just the sentence
ids and similarity values, but also the actual texts themselves... Also, we want
the reports to contain id, text and similarity value for the 3 most similar
sources for every sentence of the target constitution.

```{r}
# create a dataframe from similarity results and make it have good names
myresultdf <- data.frame(mysimildf$id_bu)
names(myresultdf)[names(myresultdf) == "mysimildf.id_bu"] <- "id_bu"

# add a text_bu column with the respective text
myresultdf$text_bu <- mysimildf$text_bu

# find 3 best sources
five_largest <- apply(mysimildf[, 1:(ncol(mysimildf) - 2)], 1, FUN = function(x) sort(tail(sort(x), 3), decreasing = TRUE))

# For source_1 to source_3, fill in id, text, and similarity value of the best sources
myresultdf$id_src_1 <- unlist(lapply(five_largest, function(l) if (length(l) > 0) { names(l)[1] } else return(NA) ), use.names = FALSE )
myresultdf$text_src_1    <- mysentences[unlist(lapply(myresultdf$id_src_1, function(l) {l[[1]]}), use.names = FALSE )]
myresultdf$simil_value_1 <- unlist(lapply(five_largest, function(l) if (length(l) > 0) { l[[1]] } else return(NA) ), use.names = FALSE )

myresultdf$id_src_2      <- unlist(lapply(five_largest, function(l) if (length(l) > 1) { names(l)[2] } else return(NA) ), use.names = FALSE )
myresultdf$text_src_2    <- mysentences[unlist(lapply(myresultdf$id_src_2, function(l) {l[[1]]}), use.names = FALSE )]
myresultdf$simil_value_2 <- unlist(lapply(five_largest, function(l) if (length(l) > 1) { l[[2]] } else return(NA) ), use.names = FALSE )

myresultdf$id_src_3      <- unlist(lapply(five_largest, function(l) if (length(l) > 2) { names(l)[3] } else return(NA) ), use.names = FALSE )
myresultdf$text_src_3    <- mysentences[unlist(lapply(myresultdf$id_src_3, function(l) {l[[1]]}), use.names = FALSE )]
myresultdf$simil_value_3 <- unlist(lapply(five_largest, function(l) if (length(l) > 2) { l[[3]] } else return(NA) ), use.names = FALSE )
```

Now we sort and save two views.

```{r}
# Finally, sort/"arrange" two ways: by similarity value and by document id
myresultdf_by_value  <- arrange(myresultdf, desc(simil_value_1))
myresultdf_by_id_bu  <- arrange(myresultdf, as.integer(sub("BU.", "", id_bu)))

# And save to two csv files
write.table(myresultdf_by_value, sep = "\t", eol = "\n", fileEncoding = "UTF-8", file = "out/simil_by_value.tsv", row.names = FALSE)
write.table(myresultdf_by_id_bu, sep = "\t", eol = "\n", fileEncoding = "UTF-8", file = "out/simil_by_text_order.tsv", row.names = FALSE)
```
